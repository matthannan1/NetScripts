"# NetScripts" 

These files depend HEAVILY on plink.exe (from puTTY suite) being available in the same directory.
Some will also require a PERL script called meili. This was developed by a guy I used to work with at IBM.
A little clunky, but workable.
The goal is to convert these scripts to Python and make them executable with py2exe.
